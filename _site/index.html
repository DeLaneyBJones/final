    <p><p>The Muppet Show is a comedy television series created by Jim Henson and featuring The Muppets. The series originated as two pilot episodes produced by Henson for ABC in 1974 and 1975, respectively. While neither episode was moved forward as a series and other networks in the United States rejected Henson’s proposals, British producer Lew Grade expressed interest in the project and agreed to co-produce The Muppet Show for ATV. Five seasons, totalling 120 episodes, were broadcast on ATV and other ITV franchises in the UK and in first-run syndication in the US from 1976 to 1981. The programme was filmed at Elstree Studios, England.</p>

<p>The Muppet Show is presented as a variety show, featuring recurring sketches and musical numbers interspersed with plotlines taking place behind the show. Within its context, Kermit the Frog acts as showrunner and host of the show, who tries to maintain control of the overwhelming antics of the other Muppet characters, as well as appease the rotating slate of guest stars.[3] The Muppet Show is also known for its uniquely designed characters, burlesque nature, physical slapstick, sometimes absurdist humor, and parodies.[4] As The Muppet Show became popular, many celebrities were eager to perform with the Muppets on television and in film.</p>

    <p><p>“The Muppet Show Theme” (written by Henson and Sam Pottle in 1976[7]) is the show’s theme song.</p>

<p>At the end of the song, Gonzo the Great appeared onstage to play the final note, with various comical results. Each episode ended with an extended instrumental performance of “The Muppet Show Theme” by the Muppet orchestra before Statler and Waldorf gave the last laugh of the night. Some last laugh sequences featured other Muppets on the balcony. For example, in one episode, the Muppets of Sesame Street appeared behind the duo who told them: “How should we know how to get to Sesame Street? We don’t even know how to get out of this stupid theater box!”</p>

<p>Every season, the TV version of the song was presented with re-worked lyrics. While the opening sequence evolved visually over the course of the show’s five seasons, the musical composition remained essentially the same. Throughout the years, the song has become a staple of the franchise.</p>

                        <p>A pragmatic frog who is the straight man protagonist and de facto leader of the Muppets. Created by Jim Henson and introduced in 1955 on Sam and Friends, Kermit quickly became the de facto face of the early franchise, including regularly appearing on Sesame Street, sometimes as a reporter. He starred on The Muppet Show, as the showrunner, responsible for managing the show's production, and has appeared in every Muppet-branded production since.</p>

She was designed and built by Bonnie Erickson. Debuted in a 1974 Herb Alpert television special, where she was performed by Jerry Nelson.[7] She is Oz's best-known character.[8]:103</p>

                        <p>A naive, comically-disinclined bear introduced in The Muppet Show. Fozzie's characterization was created by Frank Oz, who performed the character from his debut in 1976 until Oz's retirement in 2000. Eric Jacobson has performed the character since then.[9] Finch calls Fozzie a sweetly insecure and absolutely terrible comedian. According to Oz, Fozzie is such a bad comedian that he can't afford good joke writers, and he can't write good jokes himself but still a good character. He was designed by Michael K. Frith.[8]:102</p>

    <p><p>Since its debut in 1969, Sesame Street had given Jim Henson’s Muppet characters exposure; however, Henson began to perceive that he was becoming typecast as a children’s entertainer. Subsequently, he began conceiving a programme for a more adult demographic. Two television specials, The Muppets Valentine Show (1974) and The Muppet Show: Sex and Violence (1975), were produced for ABC and are considered pilots for The Muppet Show. Neither of the two specials was ordered to series. However, the prime-time access rule was recently enacted, shifting the 7:30 to 8 pm ET slot from the networks to their affiliates. CBS became interested in Henson’s series proposals and expressed intent to broadcast it weekly on its owned and operated stations.[citation needed] According to the original pitch reel, George Schlatter was originally involved.</p>

Both episodes were edited. In addition to replacing the first series opening and the ending logos with Zoot, the Vincent Price episode was edited to remove the songs I'm Looking Through You and You've Got a Friend (the latter of which would be cut again when released on the first series DVD) as well as a sketch with the talking houses, while the Alice Cooper episode removed Robin's performance of Somewhere Over the Rainbow.</p>
