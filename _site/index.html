    <p><p>Dinosaurs are a diverse group of reptiles of the clade Dinosauria. They first appeared during the Triassic period, between 243 and 233.23 million years ago, although the exact origin and timing of the evolution of dinosaurs is the subject of active research. They became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates after the Triassic–Jurassic extinction event 201 million years ago; their dominance continued through the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. The fossil record demonstrates that birds are modern feathered dinosaurs, having evolved from earlier theropods during the Late Jurassic epoch. As such, birds were the only dinosaur lineage to survive the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event 66 million years ago. Dinosaurs can therefore be divided into avian dinosaurs, or birds; and non-avian dinosaurs, which are all dinosaurs other than birds.</p>

<p>We all know T. rex as a huge, ferocious monster from the past that wants nothing more than to consume everything that lives. However, in real life, Tyrannosaurus rex hardly lives up to its Hollywood reputation. In fact, it is now widely believed in the scientific community that Tyrannosaurus rex was not a hunter at all. However, T. rex was not the only giant carnivorous dinosaur to exist during the Mesozoic Era. Compared to some of the truly horrifying theropods out there, Tyrannosaurus rex looks like a cute puppy dog. Although T. rex will always be the “king of the dinosaurs” in our hearts, it is time to examine some contenders that might overthrow this behemoth for the title.</p>

                            <p>Perhaps the best-known dinosaur on this list, Allosaurus was a Jurassic-era theropod which lived in what is now the United States Of America. The creature had a surprisingly sleek appearance for a large theropod, with a thin neck and semi-thick legs.Unlike other theropods that lived during the Jurassic Period, Allosaurus was built for speed and was the fastest large theropod at the time. With a maximum running speed of 21 kilometers per hour (13 mph), Allosaurus was able to easily outrun its prey on a regular basis.Allosaurus was also rather long for its time—between 8–11 meters (25–35 ft) long from snout to tail tip. Allosaurus was so different from other Jurassic-era dinosaurs that its name actually means “Different Lizard.” Apparently, the paleontologist that named Allosaurus thought that he was so scary and unique that he deserved to be named as such.</p>

                        <div class="row">
                            <p>Spinosaurus was a carnivorous theropod that lived during the Cretaceous Period in what is now North Africa. It had a sleek, torpedolike appearance with a thin neck, tail, legs, and skull. It was the largest predatory dinosaur of all time, even bigger than the theropods Tyrannosaurus rex or Giganotosaurus.Spinosaurus‘s most obvious claim to fame was the giant sail running down its back. Although the true purpose of the sail is unknown, the leading scientific theory says that it was used to attract mates in a similar manner to the modern-day peacock’s tail. Still, the debate rages on.Spinosaurus was also the only dinosaur that actively tangled with Sarcosuchus, a 12-meter (40 ft), 10-ton crocodile. As a result, it is clear that Spinosaurus was a dinosaur more than capable of holding the title of “king of the dinosaurs.”</p>
