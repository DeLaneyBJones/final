The creature had a surprisingly sleek appearance for a large theropod, with a thin neck and semi-thick legs.Unlike other theropods that lived during the Jurassic Period, Allosaurus was built for speed and was the fastest large theropod at the time. With a maximum running speed of 21 kilometers per hour (13 mph), Allosaurus was able to easily outrun its prey on a regular basis.Allosaurus was also rather long for its time—between 8–11 meters (25–35 ft) long from snout to tail tip. Allosaurus was so different from other Jurassic-era dinosaurs that its name actually means “Different Lizard.” Apparently, the paleontologist that named Allosaurus thought that he was so scary and unique that he deserved to be named as such."],
                    ["Spinosaurus","../assets/images/1-Spinosaurus.jpg","Spinosaurus was a carnivorous theropod that lived during the Cretaceous Period in what is now North Africa. It had a sleek, torpedolike appearance with a thin neck, tail, legs, and skull. It was the largest predatory dinosaur of all time, even bigger than the theropods Tyrannosaurus rex or Giganotosaurus.Spinosaurus‘s most obvious claim to fame was the giant sail running down its back. Although the true purpose of the sail is unknown, the leading scientific theory says that it was used to attract mates in a similar manner to the modern-day peacock’s tail. Still, the debate rages on.Spinosaurus was also the only dinosaur that actively tangled with Sarcosuchus, a 12-meter (40 ft), 10-ton crocodile. As a result, it is clear that Spinosaurus was a dinosaur more than capable of holding the title of “king of the dinosaurs.”"]
