Dinosaurs are a diverse group of reptiles of the clade Dinosauria. They first appeared during the Triassic period, between 243 and 233.23 million years ago, although the exact origin and timing of the evolution of dinosaurs is the subject of active research. They became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates after the Triassic–Jurassic extinction event 201 million years ago; their dominance continued through the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. The fossil record demonstrates that birds are modern feathered dinosaurs, having evolved from earlier theropods during the Late Jurassic epoch. As such, birds were the only dinosaur lineage to survive the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event 66 million years ago. Dinosaurs can therefore be divided into avian dinosaurs, or birds; and non-avian dinosaurs, which are all dinosaurs other than birds. 

We all know T. rex as a huge, ferocious monster from the past that wants nothing more than to consume everything that lives. However, in real life, Tyrannosaurus rex hardly lives up to its Hollywood reputation. In fact, it is now widely believed in the scientific community that Tyrannosaurus rex was not a hunter at all. However, T. rex was not the only giant carnivorous dinosaur to exist during the Mesozoic Era. Compared to some of the truly horrifying theropods out there, Tyrannosaurus rex looks like a cute puppy dog. Although T. rex will always be the “king of the dinosaurs” in our hearts, it is time to examine some contenders that might overthrow this behemoth for the title.
