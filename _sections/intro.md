The Muppet Show is a comedy television series created by Jim Henson and featuring The Muppets. The series originated as two pilot episodes produced by Henson for ABC in 1974 and 1975, respectively. While neither episode was moved forward as a series and other networks in the United States rejected Henson's proposals, British producer Lew Grade expressed interest in the project and agreed to co-produce The Muppet Show for ATV. Five seasons, totalling 120 episodes, were broadcast on ATV and other ITV franchises in the UK and in first-run syndication in the US from 1976 to 1981. The programme was filmed at Elstree Studios, England.

The Muppet Show is presented as a variety show, featuring recurring sketches and musical numbers interspersed with plotlines taking place behind the show. Within its context, Kermit the Frog acts as showrunner and host of the show, who tries to maintain control of the overwhelming antics of the other Muppet characters, as well as appease the rotating slate of guest stars.[3] The Muppet Show is also known for its uniquely designed characters, burlesque nature, physical slapstick, sometimes absurdist humor, and parodies.[4] As The Muppet Show became popular, many celebrities were eager to perform with the Muppets on television and in film.
